very popular at my house
Too much orange, not enough tangerine.
Artificial tasting
Excellent choice
Nice tasting drink
Too sweet, too expensive, too much packaging
Sweet and definitely full of tangerine goodness~
Flavor with fizz
Good stuff
Tastes like an energy drink
No point in having carbonated juice
Orange-Tangerine Carbonated Fruit Drink
Tangy and Pleasingly "Real"
carbonated juice beats sodas
Soda Juice II
It was - Ok...
Didn't like the flavor, aftertaste, or quantity
Suprisingly rich flavor
Really Good
Tastes like Orange Crush but without the Sugar/Corn Syrup
AN EXTREMELY PLEASANT CARBONATED DRINK!
Tastes Like Carbonated Tang
Small can
Not for me
Fizzy Citrus
Fruity and bubbly, not so orangy
Better than expected
If only it were diet too!
It's OK, but I prefer the Tropicana version.
A tad syrupy
Great taste - not overly sweet
A decent diversion if you're tired of colas...
"Switch" to a "Real" Energy Drink
Sweet fizzy juice product
Tasty but too petite for me.
This drink is perfect and that's just that
Yum - carbonated fruit juice
Surprisingly good for a "soda"...
Decent enough, but pricey
Overly sweet orange soda

Flavorful, and good!
Glorious
The New Juice
A flavor winner
Very nice tangerine soda

Refreshingly Lite Natural Drink
Not as tasty as it could be
OK but not my fav
A little funky, but not bad.
Pricey sugar, okay taste
Good taste but high in calorie
Oranginaish
Good flavor, small serving, high in calories
Not A Bad Alternative To Soda, But Not A Great One Either
Carbonated orange juice in a can
Not a fan, has an odd taste - Carbonation in minimal
The Switch vs. Soda
Not terrible ... but I'd rather just have orange juice
Tasty & Not Too Sweet
Syrupy tasting, Unlikeable flavor. Yuk!
Enjoyable
Refreshing
Great Alternative to Soda
REFRESHING ORANGE JUICE DRINK WITH A KICK

Tasty but expensive
Not that great...
Was not a hit at our house...
Great taste, but ---
Tangy, less sweet
Unique and pleasing taste
Great Surprise
Not my favorite
Tangerine juice soda
Refreshing & Natural
Anything Orangey, and tangeriney is worth a try!
I loved it!
Not for Me
Yummy and fizzy!
Amazing Fruit Juice Spritzer
A combination of juice and carbonation, 100% juice, no sugar, no artificial flavors
Fizzy and Tasty, but nothing special
A good option...
Fizzlicious  and tangy
Delicious!
Great Alternative to High Fructose Corn Syrup Laden Sodas
Tasty refuel after exercise or liven up a lunch; 100% juice, 0% bad stuff
Mona Lisa
Low carbonation, 100% juice
Think a slightly fizzier Orangina....
light and refreshing
Surprisingly tasty
My least favorite of the four I tried
Not so good
Delicious
Great Taste
Not good enough for me to make The Switch
Light and tasty beverage with no HFCS
Tastes good but...
Reminiscent of regular orange soda
Switch Orange Tangerine - 8.3 Ounce Can
Great fruit drink
Decent tasting, but too small and overpriced
**Odd**Tasting, But Natural!
Not So Bold Soda Alternative
tangy orange-y bubbly stuff .... yum!
I wish it were either orange or tangerine.
very tasty 'natural' soda
I wanted to like it more
Tasty but Calorific
Tastes almost like a "regular" orange/tangerine soda!
Orange Tangerine Switch
Too Sweet for This Sugar Freak
36g of sugar still there!
Lame
Yummy!
Would Not Switch
Unless you really want Vitamin C in your soda, not really worth it.
Delicious
yummy!
They need to leave out the sugar, next
Too Sweet
Very good, could be a bit better.
Very harsh, too-sweet flavor.
Extra sweet and very carbonated
Well it's better than the black cherry anyway
Not My Thing; But You Might Enjoy
This is really good, especially if you like 100% juice
Much better than regular soda
Interesting switch from soda
Medicine-like after taste
I loved this drink...
The Best Yet
A solid juice offering
Very refreshing!
"Switch Orange Tagerine"!
Sweet & Fruity
"I'd Rather Fight Than Switch"
A Wish for Guilt Free Flavor
Refreshing, but has Unnatural Aftertaste
Make the Switch to a Healthier Beverage
What's it all about???
I had high hopes, am a bit disappointed
Tastes like soap.
A ton of tangerine taste - in a tiny can!
Smooth flavor
Super Satisfying Taste
A decent carbonated fruit drink that offers a healthier alternative to normal soda
Nothing great about this
Too sweet!
Nothing special
Refreshing!
Furniture Polish with an Aftertaste
Yuck!
Very Juicy Like
Surprisingly Good
Taste as Advertised
Soda Substitute that tastes Similar to the Original
All natural refreshment
Powerful little drink
Tastes like chemicals
Switch Flashback to my childhood - bad memories man
Interesting. Better than Watermelon.
A nice alternative to soda
Tasty Orange Soda
Not a soft drink, more like carbonated orange juice
Fresh, light taste
Excellent excellent excellent
Torn
No corn syrup, but way too sweet
I recommend other flavors instead
Crisp, and suprisingly sweet drink, but lots of calories AND pricey
Too sweet to drink uncut.
small size and mediocre taste
Switch "Orange Tangerine" is misnamed...and perhaps a bit overpriced, and NOT A DIET DRINK!
Yuck!
Very Tasty Natural Drink
Excellent
Excellent!!
Ok Soda--like slightly lugubrious tang in a can.
Not bad.  Nothing special about it.
Never received the product
Not bad at all
okay, but...
No.
It's all in the numbers...
Didn't Taste Great!
No sugar, but not low-calorie
Too much sugar, too expensive
Switch On
A Nice Change
Not bad
Questionable "healthy" drink...
It's all natural, but that doesn't mean it's good for you...
To much and not enough...
Strange...
Good Ingredients, Weak Taste
Healthy Drink that tastes GREAT
Good for sipping - a LOT of sugar!
cloying
Sweet and Refreshing!
A Muddy Orange Flavor
Some Things Were Not Meant to be Carbonated
Tasty alternative to the usual sodas
Just a soda
only so-so....
Meh...
a great soda.....
Going beyond sugar water + CO2
Nice Fruity Flavor
As Jules from Pulp Fiction would say, this is a tasty beverage!
Pretty good...
Great alternative
My Son's Favorite "Soda"
tangy
Great Product!
Great Orange Bevvie
My kids love it...
Nice Alternative
Way, way, WAY too sweet - 29g of suger in a 8.3 oz can, soda doesn't have this much sugar!
Delightfully Delicious & Natural Tasting!
Actually tastes like real oranges
different than regular soda
Too Sweet - Too Late
A tangerine drink that doesn't taste watery! Hooray for Switch!
Really, just bubbles and vitamin C
Tasty
They got it right
Exactly what is claims to be!
Quite tasty & enjoyable, sweet carbonated beverage!
It's OK, not the best, not the worst
Good but nothing special
not bad but not enough zing
How I miss the taste of sugar
Really Not Too Bad
It's Okay
Great Taste - Refreshing with or without Ice
Excellant!
Not bad, not great
A fine citrus beverage from The Switch
Great Taste but not New Taste
Not bad..
Naturally Delicious
Pricey yet surprisingly refreshing!
Delicious!  And no aftertaste!
Not Bad, but Not Great
A Uniquely Tasty Beverage
Decent, but tastes a little "odd"
Refreshing and not too sweet
Now that's orange
Sweet and Carbonated Like Energy Drinks but Without the Sugar
Pretty good
Very Good!
Too much mint
My favorite!
I love this tea and so do all my friends
